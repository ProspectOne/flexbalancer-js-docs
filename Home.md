## Welcome to [PerfOps](https://perfops.net/) Custom Code FlexBalancers!

With the Custom Code FlexBalancer feature you are able to write your own javascript code and deploy it to our infrastructure. That gives you full control to build your own custom and complex logic. You get access to our data platform and synthetic monitoring and you are also able to pull in your own external data and use it as an additional parameter when deciding how to route a request!
